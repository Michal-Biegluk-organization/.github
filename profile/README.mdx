## 📈 GitHub Stats
<!--
  The GitHub stats image is wrapped in a <details> tag to lazy-load it.
  This improves initial page load performance by deferring the image request
  until the user explicitly clicks to view the stats.
-->
<details>
  <summary>Click to view GitHub stats</summary>
  <!--
    Performance optimizations for this image:
    - loading="lazy": Defers loading until it's about to be viewed.
    - decoding="async": Decodes the image off the main thread to reduce delay.
    - fetchpriority="low": Indicates low priority as it is hidden in <details>.
    - cache_seconds=86400: Maximizes cache efficiency for 24 hours.
    - disable_animations=true: Reduces SVG file size and load time.
    - hide=contribs,prs,issues: Reduces file size and backend processing time by excluding stats.
    - hide_rank=true: Disables the computationally expensive rank calculation.
