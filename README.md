# GitHub Profile Repository

This repository is a special GitHub repository used to display a public profile on GitHub. The content of the `profile/README.mdx` file is what appears on the GitHub profile page for the user [MichaelBiegluk](https://github.com/MichaelBiegluk).

## How It Works

GitHub automatically recognizes repositories named after a user's username and uses the `README.md` or `README.mdx` file in the `profile` directory as the profile's content. This allows for a highly customizable and dynamic profile page.

## Purpose of this Repository

The purpose of this repository is solely to house the `profile/README.mdx` file. There is no other code or functionality in this repository. The `profile/README.mdx` file has been documented with HTML-style comments to explain its structure.
